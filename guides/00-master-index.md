## üöÄ Pro Tips for Success

### 1. **Start Small, Build Gradually**
Don't try to learn everything at once. Master the basics first, then add AI features, then optimize workflows.

### 2. **Practice Daily**
Even 10-15 minutes of focused practice daily is better than long sporadic sessions.

### 3. **Force Good Habits**
Disable arrow keys to force vim motion learning. Use AI tools even for simple questions to build the habit.

### 4. **Document Your Learning**
Keep notes on what works for you. Create your own shortcuts and patterns.

### 5. **Be Patient with AI**
AI responses improve as you learn to ask better questions and provide better context.
