  for (let i = 0; i < users.length; i++) {
    if (users[i].active && users[i].age >= 18) {
      result.push({
        id: users[i].id,
        name: users[i].firstName + ' ' + users[i].lastName,
        email: users[i].email,
        subscription: users[i].premium ? 'premium' : 'basic'
      });
    }
  }
  return result;
}

// <Space>pr ‚Üí Choose Claude ‚Üí "Make this production-ready TypeScript with proper types, error handling, and modern patterns"

// Claude provides comprehensive refactoring with types, validation, functional patterns
```

**Quick Improvements ‚Üí GPT-4**:
```javascript

const colors = ['red', 'blue', 'green'];
colors.forEach((color) => {
  console.log(color);
});

// <Space>pr ‚Üí Choose GPT-4 ‚Üí "Make this more modern and functional"

// GPT-4 provides quick, clean improvements
```

**Research-Based Improvements ‚Üí Perplexity**:
```python
# Select Python code:
def fetch_data(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    return response.json()

# <Space>pr ‚Üí Choose Perplexity ‚Üí "Update this to use current Python best practices and latest libraries"
