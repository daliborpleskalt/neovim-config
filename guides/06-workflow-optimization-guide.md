| **Implementation** | Vim editing | LSP completion | Avante edit |
| **Problem Solving** | Analysis | Multiple file context | CodeCompanion chat |
| **Architecture** | Planning | File exploration | CodeCompanion discussion |
| **Learning** | Practice | Documentation | Parrot multi-provider |

## 🎨 Master Workflow Patterns

### 1. The Investigation Pattern

**Use when**: Debugging, understanding new code, or exploring unfamiliar codebases

```bash
# Step 1: Get oriented
<Space>e                    # Open Neo-tree for structure overview
<Space>ff                   # Find the main file with Telescope

# Step 2: Navigate the code  
gd                          # Go to definition (LSP)
gr                          # Find all references (LSP)
<C-o>                       # Jump back to previous location

# Step 3: Gather context
<Space>o                    # Focus Neo-tree to see file relationships
# Open related files in splits

# Step 4: Ask AI for help
<Space>aa                   # Ask Avante about specific code
<Space>cc                   # Start CodeCompanion chat for deeper discussion
```

**Example scenario**: "Investigating a bug in user authentication"
```bash
1. <Space>ff → "auth" → find authentication files
2. gd on authenticate() function → see implementation
3. gr → find all places that call authenticate()
4. <Space>e → explore related files (middleware, models, tests)
5. <Space>cc → "I'm debugging an auth issue. Here's what I found..."
```

### 2. The Feature Development Pattern

**Use when**: Building new features from scratch

```bash
# Step 1: Plan with AI
<Space>cc                   # CodeCompanion for architecture discussion
# Discuss requirements, approach, and structure

# Step 2: Create structure
<Space>e                    # Open Neo-tree
# Navigate to feature location
a → feature-name/           # Create feature directory
# Create component files, tests, etc.

# Step 3: Implement with assistance
# Open files in splits for context
<Space>ae                   # Avante edit for code generation
<Space>pp → Claude          # Complex logic with Claude
<Space>pp → GPT-4          # UI components with GPT-4

# Step 4: Refine and test
<Space>lf                   # Format code
<Space>aa                   # Ask for review/improvements
```

**Example scenario**: "Building a user profile feature"
```bash
1. <Space>cc → "I need to build a user profile feature with edit capabilities"
2. Plan component structure and data flow
3. <Space>e → navigate to components/
4. Create UserProfile/ directory with all files
5. Implement components with AI assistance
6. <Space>aa → review and optimize
```

### 3. The Refactoring Pattern

**Use when**: Improving existing code, modernizing legacy code, or optimizing performance

```bash
# Step 1: Analyze current state
<Space>e                    # Explore file structure
# Select files that need refactoring
<Space>aa                   # Ask Avante for analysis

# Step 2: Plan refactoring approach  
<Space>cc                   # Discuss strategy with CodeCompanion
# Get advice on patterns, architecture

# Step 3: Execute refactoring
# Visual select code sections
<Space>ae                   # Avante edit for improvements
<Space>pr → Claude          # Complex refactoring with Claude

# Step 4: Validate changes
gd, gr                      # Check LSP references
<Space>aa                   # Ask for final review
```

**Example scenario**: "Refactoring a large React component"
```bash
1. Open the large component file
2. <Space>aa → "Analyze this component for refactoring opportunities"
3. <Space>cc → "How should I break this into smaller components?"
4. Plan the component hierarchy
5. Create new component files in Neo-tree
6. <Space>ae → extract parts into new components
7. Update imports and validate with LSP
```

### 4. The Learning Pattern

**Use when**: Learning new technologies, patterns, or best practices

```bash
# Step 1: Research and understand
<Space>pp → Perplexity      # Research current best practices
<Space>pp → GPT-4          # Get conceptual explanations

# Step 2: See examples in context
<Space>ff                   # Find existing examples in codebase
gd, gr                      # Explore with LSP navigation

# Step 3: Practice and implement
<Space>ae                   # Try implementing with AI guidance
<Space>cc                   # Discuss approach and get feedback

# Step 4: Experiment and iterate
# Make changes and test
<Space>aa                   # Ask for improvements and alternatives
```

**Example scenario**: "Learning React Hooks patterns"
```bash
1. <Space>pp → Perplexity → "Current React Hooks best practices 2025"
2. <Space>pp → GPT-4 → "Explain useEffect with practical examples"
3. <Space>ff → find existing hooks in codebase
4. <Space>cc → "Help me understand this hook pattern I found"
5. Create new hook file and implement with <Space>ae
6. <Space>aa → review and optimize implementation
```

## ⚡ Speed Optimization Techniques

### 1. Keymap Muscle Memory Development

**Practice these daily combinations**:
```bash
# File navigation speed runs
<Space>ff → type filename → <CR>         # < 2 seconds
<Space>e → navigate → <CR> → <Space>e    # < 3 seconds
gd → examine → <C-o>                     # < 1 second

# AI assistance speed runs  
<Space>aa → question → review            # < 30 seconds
vip → <Space>ae → description            # < 10 seconds
<Space>cc → start conversation           # < 5 seconds
```

### 2. Context Switching Optimization

**Minimize mental context switches**:
```bash
# Batch similar operations:
1. All file exploration first (Neo-tree + Telescope)
2. All code analysis next (LSP navigation + reading)
3. All AI consultation together (plan with one tool)
4. All implementation in focused session
```

### 3. Multi-window Efficiency

**Master window management**:
```bash
# Standard layout:
<Space>e                    # Neo-tree on left (30% width)
<Space>ff → <CR>           # Main file in center (70% width)
s                          # Split horizontally for related files
S                          # Split vertically for tests/docs

# Navigation between windows:
<C-h>                      # Move to Neo-tree
<C-l>                      # Move to main editor
<C-j>/<C-k>               # Move between splits
```

## 🧠 Cognitive Load Management

### 1. Information Hierarchy

**Prioritize information by importance**:
```bash
Level 1: Current task and immediate context
- Active file content
- Current function/component
- Immediate error messages

Level 2: Related context
- File structure (Neo-tree)
- Related files and imports
- LSP references and definitions

Level 3: Extended context  
- Project architecture
- Documentation and examples
- AI assistance and explanations
```

### 2. Progressive Disclosure

**Reveal complexity gradually**:
```bash
# Start simple:
<Space>aa → "What does this function do?"

# Add detail:
<Space>cc → "Explain the architecture behind this pattern"

# Deep dive:
<Space>pp → Claude → "Analyze performance implications"
```

### 3. Context Preservation

**Maintain mental models**:
```bash
# Use marks for important locations:
ma                         # Mark current position as 'a'
'a                         # Return to mark 'a'

# Keep Neo-tree open for structure awareness
# Use tabs for different contexts:
t                          # Open in new tab (from Neo-tree)
gt                         # Switch between tabs
```

# Vim motion practice:
- Navigate a file using only hjkl, w/b/e, f/F, t/T
- Practice text objects: diw, ciw, di", da(, etc.
- Use search and jump commands: /, n, *, #

# Tool integration practice:
- <Space>ff → find file → edit → close (under 10 seconds)
- <Space>e → navigate → create file → name it
- <Space>aa → ask simple question → review response
```

**Weekly skill building (30 minutes)**:
```bash
# Advanced techniques:
- Record and use macros (qa...q, @a)
- Practice complex text objects and motions
- Learn new AI prompting techniques
- Explore LSP features (code actions, refactoring)
```

### 2. Efficiency Metrics

**Track your speed improvements**:
```bash
# Navigation metrics:
- Time to find and open any file: target < 5 seconds
- Time to jump to definition and back: target < 2 seconds  
- Time to create new file in right location: target < 10 seconds

# AI assistance metrics:
- Time to get useful answer from AI: target < 30 seconds
- Quality of AI responses (track what works)
- Reduction in documentation lookup time
```

### 3. Workflow Refinement

**Monthly workflow review**:
```bash
# Questions to ask:
- Which keybindings do I use most? (optimize further)
- Which AI interactions are most valuable? (develop patterns)
- What slows me down most? (find solutions)
- Where do I waste mental energy? (automate or simplify)
```

gd/gr → trace data flow

# Frontend work:  
<Space>e → navigate to components
<Space>pp → GPT-4 → UI design discussion
<Space>ae → implement components
<Space>aa → optimize and review

# Integration:
<Space>cc → discuss API integration patterns
Test and refine end-to-end
```

### 2. The Documentation-Driven Development

**Use AI to maintain living documentation**:
```bash
# Before implementing:
<Space>cc → document the planned approach
<Space>ae → generate code comments and JSDoc

# During implementation:
<Space>aa → explain complex logic for documentation
<Space>pr → improve code readability

# After implementation:
<Space>cc → generate user-facing documentation
Update README and examples
```

### 3. The Test-Driven AI Development

**Combine TDD with AI assistance**:
```bash
# Write tests first:
<Space>cc → "Help me design tests for [feature]"
<Space>ae → generate test cases

# Implement with AI:
<Space>aa → "Make this code pass the tests"
<Space>ae → refactor implementation

# Refine:
<Space>cc → "How can I improve test coverage?"
Add edge cases and integration tests
```
